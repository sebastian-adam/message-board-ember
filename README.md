## Description
This app yields a question and answer message board where a user submits a question and other users can respond with answers. Additional features include temporary storage of a user's favorited questions, an up-voting (and down-voting) system for answers, and a filter for hiding answers with very poor ratings.

## User Stories

* Questions have the content of the question itself, an author and additional notes.

* Answers have the content of the answer and the author.

* A header and navbar appear on all pages containing the name of your site and a link to the home page.

* A list of all questions appears on the homepage, with only the question and the name of the author showing.

* Users can click on a question to view additional information.

* Users can add and edit questions.

* Users can add answers to a question. Answers are added and viewed on the same page as the question they respond to.

* Users can upvote the answer they think is best, and answers are sorted by number of upvotes.

* Question tiles display the number of associated answers with a computed property.

* Users can create lists of favorite questions (and their answers) to reference later.

* Special icons are used for favorited questions and poorly rated answers.
